                <h2>Something about my <span>Past</span></h2>
                    <p>In my past, I embarked on an extraordinary journey as a scuba diving professional, which led me to live in various corners of the world, including Egypt, Australia, and Madagascar. This immersive experience introduced me to the rich tapestry of different cultures and taught me invaluable life lessons. Living abroad, I learned not only to adapt but to thrive in diverse environments, deal with challenging situations, and connect with people from all walks of life. <br>
                        During this time, I also had the privilege of witnessing the stunning beauty of our oceans, which instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility for environmental conservation. This newfound awareness prompted me to extend my creative talents as a photographer and environmental documentarist, allowing me to capture the fragile wonders of our planet while advocating for its protection. <br>
                        In addition to my work in the underwater world, I managed a scuba diving school and a lodge, which provided an entirely different set of experiences. This role taught me the intricacies of leadership, effective team collaboration, and the importance of maintaining high standards in the work industry. <br>
                        My past is a mosaic of diverse experiences that have shaped my character, instilled a love for the environment, and equipped me with a versatile skill set to navigate various aspects of life and work.

            <h2>Something about my <span>Present</span></h2>
                <p>In my present, I find myself immersed in the vibrant city of Bonn in Germany, where I have embarked on a transformative journey. <br> 
                    Currently, I am a full-time student at Start2Impact University, a dynamic and forward-thinking institution that has equipped me with the cutting-edge skills necessary to become a Full-Stack Developer. <br> 
                    The program at Start2Impact is not just an education; it's a pathway to a new career. With an innovative curriculum and a commitment to fostering creativity, problem-solving, and real-world application of technology, it has provided me with the tools I need to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape. <br> 
                    This transition from my previous role as a scuba diving instructor, photographer, and environmental filmmaker to the world of web development is an exciting and purposeful one. <br> It represents a significant step towards my aspirations of leveraging technology to make a positive impact and contribute to a sustainable and interconnected future.

            <h2>Something about my <span>Future</span></h2>
                <p>In my quest for the future, my goals are firmly anchored in the realms of technology and environmental advocacy, with a strong commitment to working on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) projects. As a Full-Stack Developer, I aspire to carve a niche for myself in the tech industry, working on projects that not only challenge my abilities but also make a meaningful difference in addressing the world's most pressing issues. <br>
                    I am deeply committed to weaving sustainability into the fabric of my work, whether it's through creating innovative digital solutions that directly contribute to the achievement of SDGs or harnessing the power of technology to raise awareness about the global challenges we face. <br>
                    Additionally, I plan to continue my journey as a visual storyteller, merging my passion for photography and environmental filmmaking with my newfound expertise in web development to amplify the impact of SDG-related initiatives. <br>
                    Ultimately, my future goals revolve around creating a harmonious synergy between technology, environmental stewardship, and the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals. I aim to use my skills and experiences to drive positive change, contribute to a more sustainable world, and inspire a global community of like-minded individuals to work collectively toward the attainment of these critical global objectives.
